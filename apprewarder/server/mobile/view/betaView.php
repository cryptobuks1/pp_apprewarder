    <h3>
        A work in progress!
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pardon our dust, we're still in beta. We apologize for any strange bugs, or any strange messages you see
        either in our app, or in social media. <br/><br/>
        If you have ANY questions at all please email us at <a href="mailto:<? print SUPPORT_EMAIL ?>"><? print SUPPORT_EMAIL ?></a>

    </p>

    <h3>
        THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW
    </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SUPPORT:</strong>  Any problems you have <strong>ANYTHING</strong>, email us <a href="<? print SUPPORT_EMAIL ?>"><? print SUPPORT_EMAIL ?></a>. It's important to us we
            get this app right and do it better than anyone else.</li>


            <li><strong>BUGS:</strong>
            Beta means you will help influence the direction of the product. If it breaks, we promise we'll fix it.
                If it sucks, we promise we will make it unsuck. ALWAYS attach screenshots so we can help you faster. Srsly.
            </li>

            <li><strong>HACKING:</strong>
                Emulators, fraud, hacking, or general tampering  is NOT permitted. Don't ruin the
                experience for others. We know who VPNs or not, don't waste your time because we do not pay out our users who
                cheat or hack. We ask that you honors our app sponsors. We expect real users, we will deliver and pay out only
                to real users.
            </li>

            <li><strong>GETTING PAID:</strong>

                Even though we're in beta, do not worry. We are very confident our points and reward system is 100% working.
              During BETA payouts for rewards will be completed in 1-2 weeks. Once
                out of beta we will payout 48 hrs or less.
            </li>

            <li><strong>REFERRALS:</strong>
                Yes. You earn 50% of your referrals earnings but please know that they must earn 600 credits before they qualify
                to earn you coins. This is a way for us to combat inactive accounts and a drain to our system.
            </li>

            <li><strong>TELLS WHAT YOU WANT:</strong>
                Seriously. This is the spirit of beta, we want this to be an app you open everyday, we want this to be your
                personal pocket ATM. We want this to be a place where you can legitimately check out awesome apps.
                We want to hear from you, what you like about the app, and especially what you don't like. See something else
                another app is doing, tell us! We're here for you.
            </li>
        </ul>
