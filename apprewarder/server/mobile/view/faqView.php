        What is AppRewarder?
    </h3>
    <p>
        AppRewarder is a fun way to discover new apps and get rewarded for it! Download and install these apps
        to earn coins that can be claimed for gift cards from Amazon, Paypal, iTunes and Google Play.
    </p>

    <h3>
        How does AppRewarder works?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Easy! When you download and try our free sponsor apps, you will earn coins,
        and coins can be redeemed for gift cards. In other words, you can get real gift cards
        without spending a penny, and it really works! This is all possible because our sponsors
        love helping people discover their cool apps, and we love helping our users earn free stuff.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Can my device run AppRewarder?
    </h3>
    <p>
        System Requirements: iOS 6.1 and Android Kit Kat 4.4
        Please note that jailbroken iOS devices and rooted Android devices are not supported and will not be able to redeem gifts.
    </p>

    <h3>
        How do I redeem my gift card?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Once you have enough coins, you can get your gift card instantly just by selecting it from our gifts page.
        All AppRewarder gift cards are granted to you as codes that can be directly redeemed online.
        We'll provide you the instructions for redeeming each particular gift card you choose. For security reasons,
        there is a 48-hour waiting period after gift cards are claimed.

    <h3>
        I downloaded an app from AppRewarder but didn't get any coins!
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are a few different reasons this might have happened:
        <ul>
            <li>You didn't download the app through AppRewarder.</li>
            <li>You didn't use the app for long enough after downloading it.</li>
            <li>You've downloaded the app in the past (you can only earn coins for trying an app for the first time, not for reinstalling it.)</li>
            <li>Some apps may require you to register or use them for a certain amount of time before coins can be earned. AppRewarder's app descriptions list the requirements for earning coins, so read carefully!</li>
            <li>Sometimes technical issues can delay coins being posted to your account. Check our Facebook and Twitter pages for information about technical issues.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>
        Some of the apps in AppRewarder can't be used on my device! How can I earn the coins offered by those apps?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Not every app on AppRewarder will be usable on every platform or device. We apologize for the inconvenience.
    </p>


    <h3>
        I shared AppRewarder on Facebook/Twitter/SMS/Email but didn't get coins!
    </h3>
    <p>
        Sharing AppRewarder is just the first step. Your friends must complete the invitation.
        After that, they must also earn at least <? print REFERRAL_PAYOUT_MIN_BONUS; ?> coins from Offers. Then you'll get your coins!
    </p>


    <h3>
        How do I transfer my coins to a new device or if I upgrade my platform?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Your older device must be linked to a Google+ account.
        Then you can log into AppRewarder on any device that uses the same Google+ account.
    </p>
