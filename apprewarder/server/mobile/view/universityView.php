            How can I earn more points?
        </h3>
        <p>
            It's simple, share your referral link. Your referral link appears at the bottom of each page.
            If a user signs up using your referral link, you will earn 50% of what they make for their
            entire life time as a user. This is powerful, because you essentially earn coins while you
            sleep. Start sharing your link and referral code!
